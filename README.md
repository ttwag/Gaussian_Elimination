# Gaussian Elimination
This program contains a function that takes a matrix A and a vector b and prints the vector x from Ax = b.
If the matrix A is not invertible, the function will print "This matrix is not invertible".

## How to Use It?
The user needs to call the gauss_eli function and pass in the matrix A and a vector b as nested list and list.
The result will be printed to the console.

## File Structure and Dependencies
The user needs to install Python and the NumPy library.
gausseli copy.py contains the function gauss_eli, which performs the Gaussian Elimination.
